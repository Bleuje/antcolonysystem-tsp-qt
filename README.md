# An implementation and visualization of the Ant Colony System algorithm.

## Introduction
A project about visualizing the Ant Colony System algorithm (with some local search improvements) using C++ with Qt. It was done as a project to learn how to create a little software. It was coded with Qt Creator

I found details about the Ant Colony System algorithm in this paper :
http://www.i3s.unice.fr/~crescenz/publications/travaux_etude/colonies_fourmis-200605-rapport.pdf
Then I added a local search (it is still optional) after each ant walk : I try to reverse or shift subsequences of the permutation many times to improve it. I think it has greatly increased the quality of my results.
